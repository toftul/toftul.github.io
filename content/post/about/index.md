# Hi 

Hi! My name is Ivan Toftul. I love science, technology, and open source.


# Science 

My main focus is in optical and acoustic manupulation. I study how linear and angular momenta can be transferred from waves to matter.

Another direction for me is resonant metasurfaces. This inlcude linear and nonlinear responces, symmetry analyses, and chiral properties.

# Open source contributions

Main things are:
- https://github.com/toftul/mielib - Python library for mie scattering coefficients in optics and acoustics
- https://github.com/toftul/refractiveindex - simple python interface for refractiveindex.info
- https://github.com/toftul/itmo-phd-thesis-template-ru and https://github.com/toftul/itmo-phd-thesis-template-en

Check my github for more.
